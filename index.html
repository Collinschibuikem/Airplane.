        <h1>AIRPLANE MODE</h1>
        <p>Today’s topic was inspired by an analogy to an <strong>airplane</strong> given by Pastor Paul, the resident pastor of Celebration Church International (CCI) Lokogoma. He began by illustrating with an example: an elderly person, around 50 years old, reminiscing about their younger days, saying, "Oh, I remember when I was much younger, I did the work of the Lord." Pastor Paul emphasized that this is not God's desire for our lives. In the Christian faith, we do not have retired generals.</p>
        <p><strong>AIRPLANE MODE</strong> - When you do not feel close to God, when you feel that God has distanced Himself from you.</p>
        <p><strong>Airplane mode</strong> on a device means losing connectivity. Similarly, many of us put ourselves in this mode, losing our connection with God. There are times you will feel that God has left you, but He has not. Psalm 13:1 captures David's lament, "How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?" David, a man after God's own heart, experienced feelings of distance from God.</p>
        <p>When these downtimes come, there is something you must do: realize you have a sixth sense, which is <strong>FAITH</strong>. Pastor Paul explained that we have five physical senses, but as believers, we also walk by faith, not by sight (2 Corinthians 5:7). Relying solely on what you see limits your experience of God's reality. As Jesus told Thomas in John 20:29, "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."</p>

        <h2>What to Do When You Do Not "Feel" Connected to God</h2>
        <p>You might be depending on your "feelings" too much. Here are two things to remember about feelings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Feelings Are Temporary</strong>: Our emotions fluctuate and do not provide a constant basis for our relationship with God.</li>
            <li><strong>Feelings Are an Inaccurate Measure of Reality</strong>: Feelings can deceive us into thinking God is far when He is near. Jeremiah 17:9 warns, "The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?"</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps to Reconnect with God</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Be Aware of Sin</strong>: Sometimes, you do not feel close to God because of unconfessed sin. Sin creates a barrier that makes you feel distant from God, though He is ever-present. Isaiah 59:1-2 says, "Surely the arm of the Lord is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to hear. But your iniquities have separated you from your God." Similarly, David prayed in Psalm 51:9-11 for God to hide His face from his sins and restore the joy of His salvation.</li>
            <li><strong>Know That There Will Be Trials</strong>: Trials can make you feel that God is far from you, whether in business, finances, career, health, or marriage. As a believer, it is crucial to understand that trials are part of the Christian journey. James 1:2-3 encourages us to "consider it pure joy whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance." Jesus also reassures us in John 16:33 (NKJV), "These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world."</li>
            <li><strong>Find Shelter</strong>: During tough times, find shelter in God and the church community. Hebrews 10:24-25 advises, "Let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another." Romans 15:1-2 (NIV) says, "We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves. Each of us should please our neighbors for their good, to build them up." Galatians 6:1-2 (NKJV) instructs, "Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourself lest you also be tempted. Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ." The community can provide guidance and support.</li>
            <li><strong>Take the Emotions/Feelings to God in Prayer</strong>: When you feel disconnected, take your emotions to God in prayer. Philippians 4:6 (NKJV) instructs, "Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God." Matthew 26:38-39 (NKJV) shows Jesus Himself saying, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with Me." He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, 'O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.'"</li>
            <li><strong>Remember That God Is Faithful</strong>: Regardless of your situation, remember that God is faithful. 2 Timothy 2:13 assures, "If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot disown Himself." James 1:17 reminds us, "Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows." Psalm 139:7-12 beautifully describes that there is nowhere we can go from God’s presence.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>May this teaching help you reconnect with God and strengthen your faith.</p>
